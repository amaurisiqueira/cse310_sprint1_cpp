# Overview

## Purpose of the Application

The main purpose of this application is to apply the knowledge gained from working with the programming languages **C++**, **Java**, and **Rust**, which were selected for the **CSE310** course.

In this first stage, a task manager was created using **C++**, which persists tasks in a log file. In the following weeks, applications will be developed in **Java** and **Rust** to handle the same log files.

This will result in a **multi-language** application.

# Development Environment

This is an application built in **C++** designed to manage pending tasks.


### Main Features

- **Add new tasks:** the user is prompted to enter a task description, which is then saved and recorded in a file for future reference.
- **Mark tasks as completed:** a procedure was created to mark a task as completed; the task ID is requested for this operation.
- **Delete tasks:** a procedure was implemented to delete a task based on its ID.
- **List tasks:** a procedure was created to list all tasks stored in the log file.
